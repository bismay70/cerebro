"""FastAPI ASGI app for everything Cerebro serves over HTTP.

There was previously no assembled FastAPI app in this repo — github/webhook.py
defined an APIRouter but nothing ever instantiated FastAPI() and mounted it,
so there was no `uvicorn cerebro.server:app` to run in production. This file
is that missing piece.

Run locally:
    uvicorn cerebro.server:app --reload --port 8000

Run in production (see the deployment guide for the full command, workers,
and process manager):
    uvicorn cerebro.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 2
